# Sinatra-App-Template
A bare bones template to start with when building a micro-service with Sinatra.


1. Copy example.env to .env to put your environment variables: `cp example.env .env`
2. Update .ruby-version to the latest (or your preferred) version of Ruby.
3. Add any additional Gems you might need to the Gemfile. Then `bundle` to install them.
4. Start building your endpoints in app.rb.
